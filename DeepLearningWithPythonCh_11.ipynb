        "In CS, we refer to human language as 'natural' languages, to distinguish them form languages designed for machines. Every machine language was designed: its starting point was a human engineer writing down a set of formal rules to describe what statements you could make in that language and what they meant.Rules came first, and people only started using the language once the rule set was complete. With human language, it's the reverse: usage comes first, rules arise later. Natural language was shaped by an evolution process, much like biological organisms - that's what makes it \"natural\". Its \"rules\", like the grammar of English, were formalized after the fact and are often ignored or broken by its users. As a result, while machine-readable language is highly structured and rigorous, using precise syntactic rules to weave together exactly defined concepts from a fixed vocabulary, natural language is messy-ambiguous, chaotic, sprawling, and constantly in flux.\\\n",
        "Modern NLP is about using machine learning and large datasets to give computers the ability not to understand language, which is a more lofty goal, but to ingest a piece of language as input and return something useful, like predicting the following:\n",

        "Deep learning models, being differentiable functions, can only process numeric tensors: they can't take raw text as input. Vectorizing text is the process of transforming text into numeric tensors. Text vectorization processes come in many shapes and forms, but they all follow the same template:\n",
        "* First, you standardize the text to make it easier to process, such as by converting it to lowercase or removing punctuation.\n",
        "* You split the text into units (called tokens), such as characters, word, or groups of words. This is called tokenization.\n",

Yet, if you were to convert them to byte strings, they would end up with very different representations, because \"i\" and \"I\" are two different characters, and so on. A machine learning model does not know a priori that \"i\" and \"I\" are the same letter, and so on.\n",
        "Text standardization is a basic form of feature engineering that aims to erase encoding differences that you don't want your model to have to deal with. It is not exclusive to machine learning either, you would have to do the same thing if you were building a search engine.\\\n",
        "One of the simplest and most widespread standardization schemes is \"convert to lowercase and remove punctuation characters\". Another comon transformation is converting special characters to a standard form.\\\n",

There are two kinds of text-processing models: those that care about word order, called sequence models, and those that treat input words as a set, discarding their original order, called bag-of-words models. If you are bulding a  sequence model, you will use word-level and if you are building a bag-of-words model, you will use N-gram. N-grams are a way to artificially inject a small amount of ocal word order information into the model.\n",

        "How a machine learning model should represent individual words is uncontroversial question: They're categorical features, and we know how to handle them. They should be encoded as dimensions in a feature space, or as category vectors. A much more problematic question, however, is how to encode the way words are woven into sentences: word order.\\\n",
        "The problem of order in natural language is an interesting one: unlike the steps of a timeseries, words in a senrence don't have a natural, canonical order. Different languages order similar words in different ways. Order is clearly important, but its relationship to meaning isn't straightforward. How to represent word order is the pivotal question from which different kinds of NLP architectures spring. The simplest thing you could do is just discard order and treat text as an unordered set of words-this gives bag-of-words models. You could also decide that words should be processed strictly in the order in which they appear, one at a time, like steps in a timeseries- you could then leverage recurrent models. Finally, hybrid approach is also possible: the Transformer architecture is technically order-agnostic, yet it injects word-position information into the representations it processes, which enables it to simultaneously look at different parts of a sentence (unlike RNN) while still being order-aware.Because they take into account word order, both RNNs and Transformers are called sequence models.\\\n",

Buy it or rent it just see it, best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film.<br /><br />Enjoy"

Except most vectorized sentences consist almost entirely of zeros, a property called \"sparsity\". That's a great property to have, as it dramatically reduces compute load and reduces the risk of overfitting. If we subtracted the mean from each feature, we'd wreck sparsity. Thus, whatever normalization scheme we use should be divide-only. What, then, should we use as the denominator? The best practice is to go with something called TF-IDF normalization - stands for \"term frequency, inverse document frequency\".\\\n",

At the same time, the frequency at which the term appears across all documents in your dataset matters too: terms that appear in almost every document aren't particularly informative, while terms that appear only in a small subset of all texts are very distinctive, and thus important. TF-IDF is a metric that fuses these two ideas. It weights a given term by taking \"term frequency\", how many times it appears in the current document, and dividing it by a measure of 'document frequency', which estimates how oftern the term comes up across the dataset.

        "### Processing words as a sequence: The sequence model approach\n",
        "These past few examples clearly show that word order matters: manual engineering of order-based features, such as bigrams, yields a nice accuracy boost. Now remember: the history of deep learning is that of a move away from manual feature engineering, toward letting models learn their own features, we exposed the model to raw word sequences and let it figure out such features on its own? This is what sequence models are about.\\\n",
        "To implement a sequence model, you start by representing your input samples as sequences of integer indices. Then, you'd map each integer to a vector to obtain vector sequences. Finally, you feed these sequences of vectors into a stack of layers that could cross-correlate features from adjacent vectors, such as a 1D convnet, a RNN, or Transformer.\\\n",
        "Nowadays, sequence modelling is almost universally done with Transformers. Oddly, one-dimensional convnets were never very popular in NLP, even though, a residual stack of depth-wise-separable 1D convolutions can often achieve comparable performance to a bidirectional LSTM, at a greatly reduced computational cost.\n",

        "A first observation: this model trains very slowly, especially compared to the lightweight model of the previous section. This is because our inputs are quite large: each input sample is encoded as a matrix of size (600,20000) (600 words per sample, 20,000 possible words). That's 12,000,000 floats for a single movie review. Our bidirectional LSTM has a lot of work to do. Second, the model only gets to 87% test accuracy-it doesn't perform nearly as well as out binary unigram model.\n",

        "### Understanding Word Embeddings\n",
        "When you encode something via one-hot you are making a feature enginnering decision. You are injecting into your model a fundamental assumption about the structure of your feature space. That assumption is taht the different tokens you are encoding are all independent from each other: one-hot vectors are all orthogonal to one another.\\\n",
        "Words form a structured space: they share information with each other. To get a bit more abstract, the geometric relationship between two word vectors should reflect the semantic relationship between these words. For instance, in a reasonable word vector space, you would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general, you expect geometric distance between any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance between the associated words. Words that mean different things should lie far away from each otherm whereas related words should be closer.\\\n",
        "Word embeddings are vector representations of words that achieve exactly this: they map human language into a structured geometric space.\\\n",
        "Wheras the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse and very high-dimensional, word embeddings are low-dimensional floating-point vectors.\\\n",
        "It’s common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional 512-dimensional, or 1,024-dimensional 330 CHAPTER 11 Deep learning for text\n",
        "when dealing with very large vocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot encoding words\n",
        "generally leads to vectors that are 20,000-dimensional or greater (capturing a vocabu-\n",
        "lary of 20,000 tokens, in this case). So, word embeddings pack more information into\n",
        "far fewer dimensions."

Possibly, but we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there is no such a thing as human language. What makes a good word-embedding space depends heavily on your task.\\\n",
